The RPM will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-verify-file-migration and the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-verify-file-migration . For installation on systems that do no support RPM and/or systemd: Build the tarball (see next section). Extract it to some location on your system, for example /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-verify-file-migration . Start the service with the following command /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-verify-file-migration/bin/dd-verify-file-migration server /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-verify-file-migration/cfg/config.yml BUILDING FROM SOURCE \u00b6 Prerequisites: Java 8 or higher Maven 3.3.3 or higher RPM Steps: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/dd-verify-file-migration.git cd dd-verify-file-migration mvn clean install If the rpm executable is found at /usr/local/bin/rpm , the build profile that includes the RPM packaging will be activated. If rpm is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using Maven's -P switch: mvn -Pprm install .
